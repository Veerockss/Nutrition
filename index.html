     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Any food that is high in calories, with very little protein is junk food. We should not be eating this on a regular basis as it is not good at all for our bodies. Junk food includes things like burgers, fries, etc.. and it is the total opposite of healthy food.

Otherwise it may cause problems for you and you body. </p>
